# Lauren-Danielson
This is my ersonal Repository for data-driven analysis at Denison University. This repository was started for my Practicum in Data Analytics class. It includes csv files, code, and data visuals. I prefer to use R, but will do some code in Python and Jupiter Notebooks.
I, Lauren Danielson, will be the author of code and contributor to this repository.
